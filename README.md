## Introduction ðŸ“–

As music is an important and progressive part of the modern world, the need for a tool that could recognize it was only growing over time which is confirmed by the popularity of Shazam. Suppose the person hears a familiar song that has listened to a thousand times long ago, and the one captures 20 seconds of a song or even less. In that case, no matter if itâ€™s intro, verse, or chorus, it will create a fingerprint for the recorded sample, consult the database for a match, and use its music recognition algorithm to tell you exactly which song you are listening to.
